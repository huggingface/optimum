Optimum is an extension of Transformers ü§ñ Diffusers üß® TIMM üñºÔ∏è and Sentence-Transformers ü§ó, providing a set of optimization tools and enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on targeted hardware, while keeping things easy to use.
</p>

## Installation

Optimum can be installed using `pip` as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install optimum
```

If you'd like to use the accelerator-specific features of Optimum, you can check the documentation and install the required dependencies according to the table below:

| Accelerator                                                                         | Installation                                                                |

The `--upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager` option is needed to ensure the different packages are upgraded to the latest possible version.

To install from source:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

For the accelerator-specific features, append `optimum[accelerator_type]` to the above command:

```bash
python -m pip install optimum[onnxruntime]@git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

## Accelerated Inference

Optimum provides multiple tools to export and run optimized models on various ecosystems:

- [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/onnx/usage_guides/export_a_model) / [ONNX Runtime](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/usage_guides/models), one of the most popular open formats for model export, and a high-performance inference engine for deployment.
- [OpenVINO](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference), a toolkit for optimizing, quantizing and deploying deep learning models on Intel hardware.
- [ExecuTorch](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-executorch/guides/export), PyTorch‚Äôs native solution for on-device inference across mobile and edge devices.
- [TensorFlow Lite](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/tflite/usage_guides/export_a_model), a lightweight solution for running TensorFlow models on mobile and edge.
- [Intel Gaudi Accelerators](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/habana/usage_guides/accelerate_inference) enabling optimal performance on first-gen Gaudi, Gaudi2 and Gaudi3.
- [AWS Inferentia](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/en/guides/models) for accelerated inference on Inf2 and Inf1 instances.
- [NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM](https://huggingface.co/blog/optimum-nvidia).

The [export](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/overview) and optimizations can be done both programmatically and with a command line.

### ONNX + ONNX Runtime

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :

```bash
pip install optimum[exporters,onnxruntime]
```

It is possible to export Transformers and Diffusers models to the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format and perform graph optimization as well as quantization easily.

For more information on the ONNX export, please check the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/onnx/usage_guides/export_a_model).

Once the model is exported to the ONNX format, we provide Python classes enabling you to run the exported ONNX model in a seemless manner using [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) in the backend.

More details on how to run ONNX models with `ORTModelForXXX` classes [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/onnxruntime/usage_guides/models).

### Intel (OpenVINO + Neural Compressor + IPEX)

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary [libraries installed](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/intel/installation).

You can find more information on the different integration in our [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/intel/index) and in the examples of [`optimum-intel`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel).

### ExecuTorch

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :

```bash
pip install optimum-executorch@git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-executorch.git
```

Users can export Transformers models to [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch) and run inference on edge devices within PyTorch's ecosystem.

For more information about export Transformers to ExecuTorch, please check the doc for [Optimum-ExecuTorch](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-executorch/guides/export).

### TensorFlow Lite

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :

```bash
pip install optimum[exporters-tf]
```

Just as for ONNX, it is possible to export models to [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) and quantize them.
You can find more information in our [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/exporters/tflite/usage_guides/export_a_model).

### Quanto

[Quanto](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto) is a pytorch quantization backend which allows you to quantize a model either using the python API or the `optimum-cli`.

You can see more details and [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto/tree/main/examples) in the [Quanto](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto) repository.

## Accelerated training

Optimum provides wrappers around the original Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) to enable training on powerful hardware easily.
We support many providers:

- [Intel Gaudi Accelerators (HPU)](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/habana/usage_guides/accelerate_training) enabling optimal performance on first-gen Gaudi, Gaudi2 and Gaudi3.
- [AWS Trainium](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/training_tutorials/sft_lora_finetune_llm) for accelerated training on Trn1 and Trn1n instances.
- ONNX Runtime (optimized for GPUs).

### Intel Gaudi Accelerators

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :

```bash
pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[habana]
```

You can find examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/quickstart) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples).

### AWS Trainium

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :

```bash
pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[neuronx]
```

You can find examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/index) and in the [tutorials](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-neuron/tutorials/fine_tune_bert).

### ONNX Runtime

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :

```bash
pip install optimum[onnxruntime-training]
```

You can find examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/usage_guides/trainer) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training).
