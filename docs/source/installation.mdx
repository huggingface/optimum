If you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you can install the base library from source as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

For the accelerator-specific features, you can install them by appending `#egg=optimum[accelerator_type]` to the `pip` command, e.g.

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git#egg=optimum[onnxruntime]
```
