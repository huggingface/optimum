The `--upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager` option is needed to ensure the different packages are upgraded to the latest possible version.

If you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you can install the base library from source as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

For the accelerator-specific features, you can install them by appending `optimum[accelerator_type]` to the `pip` command, e.g.

```bash
python -m pip install optimum[onnxruntime]@git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```
