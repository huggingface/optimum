# Optimum pipelines for inference

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function makes it simple to use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for accelerated inference on a variety of tasks such as text classification, question answering and image classification.

<Tip>

You can also use the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) function from Transformers and provide your Optimum model class.

</Tip>

Currenlty supported tasks are:

**ONNX Runtime**

* `feature-extraction`
* `text-classification`
* `token-classification`
* `question-answering`
* `zero-shot-classification`
* `text-generation`
* `text2text-generation`
* `summarization`
* `translation`
* `image-classification`

## Optimum pipeline usage

While each task has an associated pipeline class, it is simpler to use the general [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function which wraps all the task-specific pipelines in one object.
The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function automatically loads a default model and tokenizer/feature-extractor capable of inference for your task.

1. Start by creating a pipeline by specifying an inference task:

```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> classifier = pipeline(task="text-classification", accelerator="ort")

```

2. Pass your input text/image to the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function:

```python
>>> classifier("I like you. I love you.")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998838901519775}]
```

_Note: The default models used in the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function are not optimized or quantized, so there won't be a performance improvement compared to their PyTorch counterparts._

### Using vanilla Transformers model and converting to ONNX

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function accepts any supported model from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).
There are tags on the Model Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task.
Once you've picked an appropriate model, load it with the `from_pretrained("{model_id}",from_transformers=True)` method associated with the `ORTModelFor*`
`AutoTokenizer' class. For example, here's how you can load the [`~onnxruntime.ORTModelForQuestionAnswering`] class for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
>>> # Loading the pytorch checkpoint and converting to ORT format by providing the from_transformers=True parameter
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2",from_transformers=True)

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

### Using Optimum models

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function is tightly integrated with [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) and can load optimized models directly, e.g. those created with ONNX Runtime.
There are tags on the Model Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task.
Once you've picked an appropriate model, load it with the `from_pretrained()` method associated with the corresponding `ORTModelFor*`
and `AutoTokenizer'/`AutoFeatureExtractor` class. For example, here's how you can load an optimized model for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")
>>> # Loading already converted and optimized ORT checkpoint for inference
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```


### Optimizing and quantizing in pipelines

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function can not only run inference on vanilla ONNX Runtime checkpoints - you can also use checkpoints optimized with `ORTQuantizer` and `ORTOptimizer`.
Below you can find two examples on how you could [`~onnxruntime.ORTOptimizer`] and [`~onnxruntime.ORTQuantizer`] to optimize/quantize your model and use it for inference afterwards.

### Quantizing with `ORTQuantizer`

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification, ORTQuantizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoQuantizationConfig
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the tokenizer and export the model to the ONNX format
>>> model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_dir = "tmp/onnx/"
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

# Load the quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.avx512_vnni(is_static=False, per_channel=True)
>>> quantizer = ORTQuantizer.from_pretrained(model)
# Apply dynamic quantization and save the resulting model
>>> quantizer.quantize(save_dir=save_dir, quantization_config=qconfig)

# Load the quantized model from a local repository
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_dir, file_name="model_quantized.onnx")

# Create the transformers pipeline
>>> onnx_clx = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> text = "I like the new ORT pipeline"
>>> pred = onnx_clx(text)
>>> print(pred)

# Save and push the model to the hub
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.push_to_hub("new_path_for_directory", repository_id="my-onnx-repo", use_auth_token=True)
```

### Optimizing with `ORTOptimizer`

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification, ORTOptimizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import OptimizationConfig
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the tokenizer and export the model to the ONNX format
>>> model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_dir = "tmp/onnx/"
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

# Load the optimization configuration detailing the optimization we wish to apply
>>> optimization_config = OptimizationConfig(optimization_level=2)
>>> optimizer = ORTOptimizer.from_pretrained(model)
# Apply optimization and save the resulting model
>>> optimizer.optimize(save_dir=save_dir, optimization_config=optimization_config)

# Load the optimized model from a local repository
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_dir, file_name="model_optimized.onnx")

# Create the transformers pipeline
>>> onnx_clx = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> text = "I like the new ORT pipeline"
>>> pred = onnx_clx(text)
>>> print(pred)

# Save and push the model to the hub
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.push_to_hub("new_path_for_directory", repository_id="my-onnx-repo", use_auth_token=True)
```

## Transformers pipeline usage

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function is just a light wrapper around the `transformers.pipeline` function to enable checks for supported tasks and additional features
, like quantization and optimization. This being said you can use the `transformers.pipeline` and just replace your `AutoModelFor*` with the optimum
 `ORTModelFor*` class.

```diff
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline
-from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering

-model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
+model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering",model=model,tokenizer=tokenizer)

question = "What's my name?"
context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."
pred = onnx_qa(question, context)
```
