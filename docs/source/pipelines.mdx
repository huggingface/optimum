# Optimum pipelines for inference

The [`pipeline`] makes it simple to use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for accelerated inference on a variety of tasks such as text classification.
Even if you don't have experience with a specific modality or understand the code powering the models, you can still use them with the [`pipeline`]! This tutorial will teach you to:

<Tip>

You can also use the `pipeline()` function from Transformers and provide your `OptimumModel`.

</Tip>

Currenlty supported tasks are:

**Onnx Runtime**

* `feature-extraction`
* `text-classification`
* `token-classification`
* `question-answering`
* `zero-shot-classification`
* `text-generation`

## Optimum pipeline usage

While each task has an associated [~`pipeline`], which it is simpler to use the general [~`pipeline`] abstraction which contains all the specific task pipelines. 
The [~`pipeline`] automatically loads a default model and tokenizer capable of inference for your task. 

1. Start by creating a [~`pipeline`] and specify an inference task:

```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> classifier = pipeline(task="text-classification", accelerator="ort")

```

2. Pass your input text to the [~`pipeline`]:

```python
>>> classifier("I like you. I love you.")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998838901519775}]
```

_Note: The default models used in the [~`pipeline`] are not optimized or quantized, there won't be an performance improvement compared to there pytorch counter parts._

### Using vanilla Transformers model and converting to ONNX

The [`pipeline`] accepts any supported model from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). 
There are tags on the Model Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task. 
Once you've picked an appropriate model, load it with the `from_pretrained("{model_id}",from_transformers=True)` method associated with the `ORTModelFor*` 
[`AutoTokenizer'] class. For example, here's how you can load the [`ORTModelForQuestionAnswering`] class for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
>>> # loading the pytorch checkpoint and converting to ORT format by providing the from_transformers=True parameter
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2",from_transformers=True)

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

### Using Optimum models

The [`pipeline`] is tightly integrated with [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) and can load optimized models directly, e.g. those created with OnnxRuntime. 
There are tags on the Model Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task. 
Once you've picked an appropriate model, load it with the `from_pretrained()` method associated with the corresponding `ORTModelFor*`
and [`AutoTokenizer'] class. For example, here's how you can load an optimized model for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")
>>> # loading already converted and optimized ORT checkpoint for inference
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```


### Optimizing and Quantizing in Pipelines

The [`pipeline`] can not only run inference on vanilla Onnxruntime checkpoints you can also use checkpoints optimized with `ORTQuantizer` and `ORTOptimizer`
Below you can find two examples on how you could [~`ORTOptimizer`] and [~`ORTQuantizer`] to optimize/quantize your model and use it for inference afterwards.

### Quantizing with [~`ORTQuantizer`]

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification, ORTQuantizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoQuantizationConfig
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# define model_id and load tokenizer
>>> model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
>>> save_path = Path("optimum_model")
>>> save_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# use ORTQuantizer to export the model and define quantization configuration
>>> quantizer = ORTQuantizer.from_pretrained(model_id, feature="sequence-classification")
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.avx512_vnni(is_static=False, per_channel=True)

# apply the quantization configuration to the model
>>> quantizer.export(
    onnx_model_path=save_path / "model.onnx",
    onnx_quantized_model_output_path=save_path / "model-quantized.onnx",
    quantization_config=qconfig,
    )
>>> quantizer.model.config.save_pretrained(save_path) # saves config.json 

# load optimized model from local path or repository
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_path,file_name="model-quantized.onnx")

# create transformers pipeline
>>> onnx_clx = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> text = "I like the new ORT pipeline"
>>> pred = onnx_clx(text)
>>> print(pred)

# save model & push model to the hub
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.push_to_hub("new_path_for_directory",
                  repository_id="my-onnx-repo",
                  use_auth_token=True
                  )
```

### Optimizing with [~`ORTOptimizer`]

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification, ORTOptimizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import OptimizationConfig
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

# define model_id and load tokenizer
>>> model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
>>> save_path = Path("optimum_model")
>>> save_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# use ORTOptimizer to export the model and define quantization configuration
>>> optimizer = ORTOptimizer.from_pretrained(model_id, feature="sequence-classification")
>>> optimization_config = OptimizationConfig(optimization_level=2)

# apply the optimization configuration to the model
>>> optimizer.export(
    onnx_model_path=save_path / "model.onnx",
    onnx_optimized_model_output_path=save_path / "model-optimized.onnx",
    optimization_config=optimization_config,
)
>>> optimizer.model.config.save_pretrained(save_path) # saves config.json 

# load optimized model from local path or repository
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_path,file_name="model-optimized.onnx")

# create transformers pipeline
>>> onnx_clx = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> text = "I like the new ORT pipeline"
>>> pred = onnx_clx(text)
>>> print(pred)

# save model & push model to the hub
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.push_to_hub("new_path_for_directory",
                  repository_id="my-onnx-repo",
                  use_auth_token=True)
```

## Transformers pipeline usage

The [`pipeline`] is just a light wrapper around the `transformers.pipeline` function to enable checks for supported tasks and additional features
, like quantization and optimization. This being said you can use the `transformers.pipeline` and just replace your `AutoFor*` with the optimum 
 `ORTModelFor*` class. 

```diff
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline
-from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering

-model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
+model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_transformers("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering",model=model,tokenizer=tokenizer)

question = "What's my name?"
context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."
pred = onnx_qa(question, context)
```
