# Quick tour

This quick tour is intended for developers who are ready to dive into the code and see examples of how to integrate ðŸ¤— Optimum into their model training and inference workflows.

## Accelerated inference

#### ONNX Runtime

To accelerate inference with ONNX Runtime, ðŸ¤— Optimum uses _configuration objects_ to define parameters for graph optimization and quantization. These objects are then used to instantiate dedicated _optimizers_ and _quantizers_.

Before applying quantization or optimization, first we need to load our model. To load a model and run inference with ONNX Runtime, you can just replace the canonical Transformers [`AutoModelForXxx`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) class with the corresponding [`ORTModelForXxx`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/package_reference/modeling_ort#optimum.onnxruntime.ORTModel) class. If you want to load from a PyTorch checkpoint, set `from_transformers=True` to export your model to the ONNX format.

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

>>> model_checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_directory = "tmp/onnx/"

>>> # Load a model from transformers and export it to ONNX
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)
>>> ort_model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, from_transformers=True)

>>> # Save the ONNX model and tokenizer
>>> ort_model.save_pretrained(save_directory)
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
```

Let's see now how we can apply dynamic quantization with ONNX Runtime:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoQuantizationConfig
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTQuantizer

>>> # Define the quantization methodology
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.arm64(is_static=False, per_channel=False)
>>> quantizer = ORTQuantizer.from_pretrained(ort_model)

>>> # Apply dynamic quantization on the model
>>> quantizer.quantize(save_dir=save_directory, quantization_config=qconfig)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
```

In this example, we've quantized a model from the Hugging Face Hub, in the same manner we can quantize a model hosted locally by providing the path to the directory containing the model weights. The result from applying the `quantize()` method is a `model_quantized.onnx` file that can be used to run inference. Here's an example of how to load an ONNX Runtime model and generate predictions with it:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer

>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_directory, file_name="model_quantized.onnx")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(save_directory)
>>> classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> results = classifier("I love burritos!")
```

You can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/quickstart) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime).


#### Intel

To load a model and run inference with OpenVINO Runtime, you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `OVModelForXxx` class.
If you want to load a PyTorch checkpoint, set `from_transformers=True` to convert your model to the OpenVINO IR (Intermediate Representation).

```diff
- from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
+ from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForSequenceClassification
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

  # Download a tokenizer and model from the Hub and convert to OpenVINO format
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
- model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
+ model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

  # Run inference!
  classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
  results = classifier("He's a dreadful magician.")
```

You can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/tree/main/examples/openvino).


## Accelerated training

#### Habana

To train transformers on Habana's Gaudi processors, ðŸ¤— Optimum provides a `GaudiTrainer` that is very similar to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer). Here is a simple example:

```diff
- from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+ from optimum.habana import GaudiTrainer, GaudiTrainingArguments

  # Download a pretrained model from the Hub
  model = AutoModelForXxx.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

  # Define the training arguments
- training_args = TrainingArguments(
+ training_args = GaudiTrainingArguments(
      output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
+     use_habana=True,
+     use_lazy_mode=True,
+     gaudi_config_name="Habana/bert-base-uncased",
      ...
  )

  # Initialize the trainer
- trainer = Trainer(
+ trainer = GaudiTrainer(
      model=model,
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=train_dataset,
      ...
  )

  # Use Habana Gaudi processor for training!
  trainer.train()
```

You can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/quickstart) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples).


#### Graphcore

To train transformers on Graphcore's IPUs, ðŸ¤— Optimum provides a `IPUTrainer` that is very similar to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer). Here is a simple example:

```diff
- from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+ from optimum.graphcore import IPUConfig, IPUTrainer, IPUTrainingArguments

  # Download a pretrained model from the Hub
  model = AutoModelForXxx.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

  # Define the training arguments
- training_args = TrainingArguments(
+ training_args = IPUTrainingArguments(
      output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
+     ipu_config_name="Graphcore/bert-base-ipu", # Any IPUConfig on the Hub or stored locally
      ...
  )

  # Define the configuration to compile and put the model on the IPU
+ ipu_config = IPUConfig.from_pretrained(training_args.ipu_config_name)

  # Initialize the trainer
- trainer = Trainer(
+ trainer = IPUTrainer(
      model=model,
+     ipu_config=ipu_config
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=train_dataset
      ...
  )

  # Use Graphcore IPU for training!
  trainer.train()
```

You can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/quickstart) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples).


#### ONNX Runtime

To train transformers with ONNX Runtime's acceleration features, ðŸ¤— Optimum provides a `ORTTrainer` that is very similar to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer). Here is a simple example:

```diff
- from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+ from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer, ORTTrainingArguments

  # Download a pretrained model from the Hub
  model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

  # Define the training arguments
- training_args = TrainingArguments(
+ training_args = ORTTrainingArguments(
      output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
      optim="adamw_ort_fused",
      ...
  )

  # Create a ONNX Runtime Trainer
- trainer = Trainer(
+ trainer = ORTTrainer(
      model=model,
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=train_dataset,
+     feature="sequence-classification", # The model type to export to ONNX
      ...
  )

  # Use ONNX Runtime for training!
  trainer.train()
```

You can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/usage_guides/trainer) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training).

## Out of the box ONNX export

The Optimum library handles out of the box the ONNX export of Transformers and Diffusers models!

Exporting a model to ONNX is as simple as

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --model gpt2 gpt2_onnx/
```

Check out the help for more options:

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --help
```

Check out the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/onnx/usage_guides/export_a_model) for more.

## PyTorch's BetterTransformer support

[BetterTransformer](https://pytorch.org/blog/a-better-transformer-for-fast-transformer-encoder-inference/) is a free-lunch PyTorch-native optimization to gain x1.25 - x4 speedup on the inference of Transformer-based models. It has been marked as stable in [PyTorch 1.13](https://pytorch.org/blog/PyTorch-1.13-release/). We integrated BetterTransformer with the most-used models from the ðŸ¤— Transformers libary, and using the integration is as simple as:

```python
>>> from optimum.bettertransformer import BetterTransformer
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
>>> model = BetterTransformer.transform(model)
```

Check out the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/bettertransformer/overview) for more details, and the [blog post on PyTorch's Medium](https://medium.com/pytorch/bettertransformer-out-of-the-box-performance-for-huggingface-transformers-3fbe27d50ab2) to find out more about the integration!

## `torch.fx` integration

Optimum integrates with `torch.fx`, providing as a one-liner several graph transformations. We aim at supporting a better management of [quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization) through `torch.fx`, both for quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ).

Check out the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/torch_fx/usage_guides/optimization) and [reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/torch_fx/package_reference/optimization) for more!
