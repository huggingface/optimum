# Adding support for an unsupported architecture

We welcome contributions to extend the functionality of ExecuTorch export. This guide provides high-level instructions for contributors who want to:

1. Export a new model that is not currently supported.
2. Add new recipes or support a new task for export.

---

## Exporting a New Model

If you want to export a model that is not already supported by the library, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Export and Test the Model
1. Attempt to export and lower the model using an existing task and recipe. On success, it will store the exported model in a `.pte` file.
2. Add a test case for the model in the appropriate test suite.
   - For example, you can make sure tests pass for the new `my_new_model` by running:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/executorch/export/test_*.py -k "test_my_new_model"  # doctest: +SKIP
     pytest tests/executorch/runtime/test_*.py -k "test_my_new_model"  # doctest: +SKIP
     ```

### Step 2: Handle Export Failures
1. If the export fails in Step 1, report the issue by opening a GitHub issue.
2. If the issue requires changes to the modelâ€™s architecture or its Hugging Face implementation, these modifications may be made upstream in the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Adding New Recipes or Tasks

To extend ExecuTorch with new recipes or tasks, follow these guidelines:

### Registering a New Recipe
You can add a custom recipe to define specific optimizations or configurations for exporting models. Below is an example:

```python
from exporters.executorch import register_recipe

@register_recipe("my_custom_recipe")
def export_with_custom_recipe(model, config, *args, **kwargs):
    # Example: Apply a custom quantization
```

### Registering a Task
The task registration process is same as adding a recipe. Besides that you may need to implement a new `ExecuTorchModelForXXX` class.
