# Overview

🤗 Optimum handles the export of PyTorch to ExecuTorch in the `exporters.executorch` module. It provides classes, functions, and a command line interface to perform the export easily.

Supported architectures from [🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index):

- Gemma
- Gemma2
- Llama2
- Llama3(Llama3.2)
- OLMo
- Qwen2(Qwen2.5)

There are many more models are supported by ExecuTorch, we will add those models to Optimum over time. Read more at [pytorch/executorch/examples/](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples)
