# Export functions

## Main functions

[[autodoc]] exporters.executorch.convert.export_to_executorch

The primary export function is designed to be **model- and task-independent** as well as **optimization-agnostic**, providing a
highly flexible and modular interface for exporting Hugging Face models to the ExecuTorch backend.

This approach highlights the **composability** of ExecuTorch export pipeline, where dynamically registered **task configurations**
specify how a :hug model is prepared, and **recipe configurations** encapsulate device-specific optimizations during export. This
separation allows users to customize the export process without altering the core function.

For more details on task and recipe configurations, see the [Configuration for ExecuTorch Export](./configuration.mdx).
