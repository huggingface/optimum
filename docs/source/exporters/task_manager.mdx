# The Tasks Manager

Exporting a model from one framework to some format (also called backend here) involves specifying inputs and outputs information that the export function needs. The way `optimum.exporters` is structured for each backend is as follows:
- Configuration classes containing the information for each model to perform the export.
- Exporting functions using the proper configuration for the model to export.

The role of the [`~optimum.exporters.tasks.TasksManager`] is to be the main entry-point to load a model given a name and a task, and to get the proper configuration for a given (architecture, backend) couple. That way, there is a centralized place to register the task -> model class and (architecture, backend) -> configuration mappings. This allows the export functions to use this, and to rely on the various checks it provides.
