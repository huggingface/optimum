# Adding support for an unsupported architecture

If you wish to export a model whose architecture is not already supported by the library, the PR [#813 Adds support for ResNet](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/pull/813 ) can be used as a reference.

You can make sure tests pass for the new `my_new_modeltype` model type by running:

```bash
pytest tests/exporters/tflite/test_*.py -k "my_new_modeltype" -s --exitfirst
```
