# Overview

🤗 Optimum handles the export of TensorFlow models to TFLite in the `exporters.tflite` module. In addition, models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub with PyTorch weights but having a TensorFlow implementation will also be supported in the export thanks to transformers' [TFPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) auto-conversion to TensorFlow.

The TFLite export support provides classes, functions, and a command line interface to perform the export easily.

Supported architectures:

- Albert
- BERT
- Camembert
- ConvBert
- Deberta
- Deberta V2
- DistilBert
- Electra
- Flaubert
- MobileBert
- MPNet
- ResNet
- Roberta
- RoFormer
- XLM
- XLMRoberta
