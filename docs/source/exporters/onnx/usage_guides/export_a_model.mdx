# Export a model to ONNX with optimum.exporters.onnx

## Summary

Exporting a model to ONNX is as simple as

```
optimum-cli export onnx --model gpt2 gpt2_onnx/
```

Check out the help for more options:

```
optimum-cli export onnx --help
```

## Why use ONNX?

If you need to deploy 🤗 Transformers models in production environments, we recommend
exporting them to a serialized format that can be loaded and executed on specialized
runtimes and hardware. In this guide, we'll show you how to export 🤗 Transformers
models to [ONNX (Open Neural Network eXchange)](http://onnx.ai).

ONNX is an open standard that defines a common set of operators and a common file format
to represent deep learning models in a wide variety of frameworks, including PyTorch and
TensorFlow. When a model is exported to the ONNX format, these operators are used to
construct a computational graph (often called an _intermediate representation_) which
represents the flow of data through the neural network.

By exposing a graph with standardized operators and data types, ONNX makes it easy to
switch between frameworks. For example, a model trained in PyTorch can be exported to
ONNX format and then imported in **TensorRT** or **OpenVINO**.

<Tip>

Once exported, a model can be optimized for inference via techniques such as
graph optimization and quantization. Check the `optimum.onnxruntime` subpackage to optimize and run ONNX models!

</Tip>


🤗 Optimum provides support for the ONNX export by leveraging configuration objects.
These configuration objects come ready made for a number of model architectures, and are
designed to be easily extendable to other architectures.

**To check the supported architectures, go to the [configuration reference page](../package_reference/configuration#supported-architectures).**

## Exporting a model to ONNX using the CLI

To export a 🤗 Transformers model to ONNX, you'll first need to install some extra
dependencies:

```bash
pip install optimum[exporters]
```

The Optimum ONNX export can be used through Optimum command-line:

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --help

usage: Hugging Face Optimum ONNX exporter [-h] -m MODEL [--task TASK] [--opset OPSET] [--atol ATOL] [--framework {pt,tf}] [--pad_token_id PAD_TOKEN_ID] [--cache_dir CACHE_DIR] output

positional arguments:
  output                Path indicating the directory where to store generated ONNX model.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Model ID on huggingface.co or path on disk to load model from.
  --task TASK           The type of task to export the model with.
  --opset OPSET         ONNX opset version to export the model with.
  --atol ATOL           Absolute difference tolerance when validating the model.
  --framework {pt,tf}   The framework to use for the ONNX export. If not provided, will attempt to use the local checkpoint's original framework or what is available in the environment.
  --pad_token_id PAD_TOKEN_ID
                        This is needed by some models, for some tasks. If not provided, will attempt to use the tokenizer to guess it.
  --cache_dir CACHE_DIR
                        Path indicating where to store cache.
```

Exporting a checkpoint can be done as follows:

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --model distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad distilbert_base_uncased_squad_onnx/
```

You should see the following logs (along with potential logs from PyTorch / TensorFlow that were hidden here for clarity):

```bash
Automatic task detection to question-answering.
Framework not specified. Using pt to export to ONNX.
Using framework PyTorch: 1.12.1

Validating ONNX model...
        -[✓] ONNX model output names match reference model (start_logits, end_logits)
        - Validating ONNX Model output "start_logits":
                -[✓] (2, 16) matches (2, 16)
                -[✓] all values close (atol: 0.0001)
        - Validating ONNX Model output "end_logits":
                -[✓] (2, 16) matches (2, 16)
                -[✓] all values close (atol: 0.0001)
All good, model saved at: distilbert_base_uncased_squad_onnx/model.onnx
```

This exports an ONNX graph of the checkpoint defined by the `--model` argument.
As you can see, the task was automatically detected. This was possible because the model was on the Hub.

For local models, providing the `--task` argument is needed or it will default to the model architecture without any task specific head:

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --model local_path --task question-answering distilbert_base_uncased_squad_onnx/
```

Note that providing the `--task` argument for a model on the Hub will disable the automatic task detection.

The resulting `model.onnx` file can then be run on one of the [many
accelerators](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html#deployModel) that support the ONNX
standard. For example, we can load and run the model with [ONNX
Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) using the `optimum.onnxruntime` package as follows:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert_base_uncased_squad_onnx")
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert_base_uncased_squad_onnx")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("What am I using?", "Using DistilBERT with ONNX Runtime!", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)
```

Printing the outputs would give that:

```bash
QuestionAnsweringModelOutput(loss=None, start_logits=tensor([[-4.7652, -1.0452, -7.0409, -4.6864, -4.0277, -6.2021, -4.9473,  2.6287,
          7.6111, -1.2488, -2.0551, -0.9350,  4.9758, -0.7707,  2.1493, -2.0703,
         -4.3232, -4.9472]]), end_logits=tensor([[ 0.4382, -1.6502, -6.3654, -6.0661, -4.1482, -3.5779, -0.0774, -3.6168,
         -1.8750, -2.8910,  6.2582,  0.5425, -3.7699,  3.8232, -1.5073,  6.2311,
          3.3604, -0.0772]]), hidden_states=None, attentions=None)
```

As you can see, converting a model to ONNX does not mean leaving the Hugging Face ecosystem. You end up with a similar API as regular 🤗 Transformers models!

<Tip>

It is also possible to export the model to ONNX directly from the `ORTModelForQuestionAnswering` class by doing the following:

```python
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad", from_transformers=True)
```

For more information, check the `optimum.onnxrutime` documentation [page on this topic](/onnxruntime/overview).

</Tip>

The process is identical for TensorFlow checkpoints on the Hub. For example, we can export a pure TensorFlow checkpoint from the [Keras
organization](https://huggingface.co/keras-io) as follows:

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --model keras-io/transformers-qa distilbert_base_cased_squad_onnx/
```

## Selecting a task

Specifying a `--task` should not be necessary in most cases when exporting from a model on the Hugging Face Hub.

However, in case you need to check for a given a model architecture what tasks the ONNX export supports, we got you covered. First, you can check the list of supported tasks for both PyTorch and TensorFlow [here](/exporters/task_manager).

For each model architecture, you can find the list of supported tasks via the [`~exporters.tasks.TasksManager`]. For example, for DistilBERT, for the ONNX export, we have:

```python
>>> from optimum.exporters.tasks import TasksManager

>>> distilbert_tasks = list(TasksManager.get_supported_tasks_for_model_type("distilbert", "onnx").keys())
>>> print(distilbert_tasks)
["default", "masked-lm", "causal-lm", "sequence-classification", "token-classification", "question-answering"]
```

You can then pass one of these tasks to the `--task` argument in the `optimum-cli export onnx` command, as mentioned above.
