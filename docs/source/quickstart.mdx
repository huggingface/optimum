# Quickstart

At its core, 🤗 Optimum uses _configuration objects_ to define parameters for optimization on different accelerators. These objects are then used to instantiate dedicated _optimizers_, _quantizers_, and _pruners_.

Before applying quantization or optimization, we first need to export our model to the ONNX format.

```python
>>> import os
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> model_checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_directory = "tmp/onnx/"
>>> file_name = "model.onnx"
>>> onnx_path = os.path.join(save_directory, "model.onnx")
>>> # Load a model from transformers and export it through the ONNX format
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, from_transformers=True)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)
>>> # Save the onnx model and tokenizer
>>> model.save_pretrained(save_directory, file_name=file_name)
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory)
```

Now let's see now how we can apply dynamic quantization with ONNX Runtime:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoQuantizationConfig
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTQuantizer
>>> # Define the quantization methodology
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.arm64(is_static=False, per_channel=False)
>>> quantizer = ORTQuantizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, feature="sequence-classification")
>>> # Apply dynamic quantization on the model
>>> quantizer.export(
...     onnx_model_path=onnx_path,
...     onnx_quantized_model_output_path=os.path.join(save_directory, "model-quantized.onnx"),
...     quantization_config=qconfig,
... )
```

In this example, we've quantized a model from the Hugging Face Hub, but it could also be a path to a local model directory. The `feature` argument in the `from_pretrained()` method corresponds to the type of task that we wish to quantize the model for. The result from applying the `export()` method is a `model-quantized.onnx` file that can be used to run inference. Here's an example of how to load an ONNX Runtime model and generate predictions with it:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_directory, file_name="model-quantized.onnx")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(save_directory)
>>> cls_pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> results = cls_pipeline("I love burritos!")
```

Similarly, you can apply static quantization by simply setting `is_static` to `True` when instantiating the `QuantizationConfig` object:

```python
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.arm64(is_static=True, per_channel=False)
```

Static quantization relies on feeding batches of data through the model to estimate the activation quantization parameters ahead of inference time. To support this, 🤗 Optimum allows you to provide a _calibration dataset_. The calibration dataset can be a simple `Dataset` object from the 🤗 Datasets library, or any dataset that's hosted on the Hugging Face Hub. For this example, we'll pick the [`sst2`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue/viewer/sst2/test) dataset that the model was originally trained on:

```python
>>> from functools import partial
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoCalibrationConfig

>>> # Create the calibration dataset
>>> calibration_dataset = quantizer.get_calibration_dataset(
...     "glue",
...     dataset_config_name="sst2",
...     preprocess_function=partial(preprocess_fn, tokenizer=quantizer.preprocessor),
...     num_samples=50,
...     dataset_split="train",
... )
>>> # Create the calibration configuration containing the parameters related to calibration.
>>> calibration_config = AutoCalibrationConfig.minmax(calibration_dataset)
>>> # Perform the calibration step: computes the activations quantization ranges
>>> ranges = quantizer.fit(
...     dataset=calibration_dataset,
...     calibration_config=calibration_config,
...     onnx_model_path=onnx_path,
...     operators_to_quantize=qconfig.operators_to_quantize,
... )
>>> # Apply static quantization on the model
>>> quantizer.export(
...     onnx_model_path=onnx_path,
...     onnx_quantized_model_output_path=os.path.join(save_directory, "model-quantized.onnx"),
...     calibration_tensors_range=ranges,
...     quantization_config=qconfig,
... )
```

As a final example, let's take a look at applying _graph optimizations_ techniques such as operator fusion and constant folding. As before, we load a configuration object, but this time by setting the optimization level instead of the quantization approach:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import OptimizationConfig

>>> # Here the optimization level is selected to be 1, enabling basic optimizations such as redundant node eliminations and constant folding. Higher optimization level will result in a hardware dependent optimized graph.
>>> optimization_config = OptimizationConfig(optimization_level=1)
```

Next, we load an _optimizer_ to apply these optimisations to our model:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTOptimizer

>>> optimizer = ORTOptimizer.from_pretrained(
...     model_checkpoint,
...     feature="sequence-classification",
... )
>>> # Export the optimized model
>>> optimizer.export(
...     onnx_model_path=onnx_path,
...     onnx_optimized_model_output_path=os.path.join(save_directory, "model-optimized.onnx"),
...     optimization_config=optimization_config,
... )
```

And that's it - the model is now optimized and ready for inference! As you can see, the process is similar in each case:

1. Define the optimization / quantization strategies via an `OptimizationConfig` / `QuantizationConfig` object
2. Instantiate a `ORTQuantizer` or `ORTOptimizer` class
3. Apply the `export()` method
4. Run inference

Happy optimising 🤗!
