# Quickstart

Since its 1.13 version, PyTorch released the stable version of `BetterTransformer` in its library. You can benefit from interesting speedup on most consumer-type devices, including CPUs, older and newer versions of NIVIDIA GPUs.
You can now use this feature in 🤗 Optimum together with Transformers and use it for major models in the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## Supported models

Let us know by opening an issue in 🤗 Optimum if you want more models to be supported, or check out the contribution guideline if you want to add it by yourself!

## Quick usage

In order to use the `BetterTransformer` API just run the following commands:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from optimum.bettertransformer import BetterTransformer
>>> model_hf = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased")
>>> model = BetterTransformer.transform(model_hf, keep_original_model=True)
```
You can leave `keep_original_model=False` in case you want to overwrite the current model with its `BetterTransformer` version.
