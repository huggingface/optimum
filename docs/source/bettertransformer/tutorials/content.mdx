# How to use `optimum` and `BetterTransformer`?

## Install dependencies

You can easily use the `BetterTransformer` integration with 🤗 Optimum, first install the dependencies as follows:

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate optimum
```

Also, make sure to install the latest version of PyTorch by following the guidelines on the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Note that `BetterTransformer` API is only compatible with `torch>=1.13`, so make sure to have this version installed on your environement before starting.

## Step 1: Load your model

First, load your Hugging Face model using 🤗 Transformers. Make sure to download one of the models that is supported by the `BetterTransformer` API:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModel

>>> model_id = "roberta-base"
>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_id)
```
<Tip>
Sometimes you can directly load your model on your GPU devices using `accelerate` library, therefore you can optionally try out the following command:
</Tip>

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModel

>>> model_id = "roberta-base"
>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="auto")
```

## Step 2: Set your model on your preferred device

If you did not used `device_map="auto"` to load your model (or if your model does not support `device_map="auto"`), you can manually set your model to a GPU:
```python
>>> model = model.to(0) # or model.to("cuda:0")
```

## Step 3: Convert your model to BetterTransformer!

Now time to convert your model using `BetterTransformer` API! You can run the commands below:

```python
>>> from optimum.bettertransformer import BetterTransformer

>>> model = BetterTransformer.transform(model)
```
By default, `BetterTransformer.transform` will overwrite your model, which means that your previous native model cannot be used anymore. If you want to keep it for some reasons, just add the flag `keep_original_model=True`!
```python
>>> from optimum.bettertransformer import BetterTransformer

>>> model_bt = BetterTransformer.transform(model, keep_original_model=True)
```
If your model does not support `BetterTransformer` API, this will displayed on an error trace. Note also that decoder-based models (OPT, BLOOM, etc.) are not supported yet but this is in the roadmap of PyTorch for the future.

## Pipeline compatibility

[Transformer's pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) is also compatible with this integration and you can use `BetterTransformer` as an accelerator for your pipelines. The code snippet below shows how:
```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> pipe = pipeline("fill-mask", "distilbert-base-uncased", accelerator="bettertransformer")
>>> pipe("I am a student at [MASK] University.")
```
If you want to run a pipeline on a GPU device, run:
```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> pipe = pipeline("fill-mask", "distilbert-base-uncased", accelerator="bettertransformer", device=0)
>>> ...
```
Please refer to the [official documentation of `pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for further usage. If you face into any issue, do not hesitate to open an isse on GitHub!
