# Normalized Configurations

Model configuration classes in 🤗 Transformers are not standardized. Although they provide an `attribute_map` attribute
that enables to aleviate that, it does not make it easy to reason on common configuration attributes in the code.
[`~optimum.utils.normalized_config.NormalizedConfig`] classes try to fix that by allowing access to the configuration
attribute they wrap in a standardized way.


## Base class

<Tip>

While it is possible to create `NormalizedConfig` subclasses for common use-cases, it is also possible to overwrite
the `original attribute name -> normalized attribute name` mapping directly using the `.with_args` class method.
