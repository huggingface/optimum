# Quantization

ðŸ¤— Optimum provides an `optimum.intel.neural_compressor` package that enables you to apply quantization on many model hosted on the ðŸ¤— hub using the [Intel Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) quantization API.

## IncQuantizer

The [`IncQuantizer`] class allows to apply different quantization approaches such as static, dynamic and aware training quantization using pytorch eager or fx graph mode.

## IncQuantizedModel

The [`IncQuantizedModel`] class allows to load a quantized pytorch model from a given configuration file summarizing the quantization performed by IntelÂ® Neural Compressor.
