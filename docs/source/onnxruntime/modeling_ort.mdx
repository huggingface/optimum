# Optimum Inference with ONNX Runtime

Optimum is a utility package for building and running inference with accelerated runtime like ONNX Runtime.
Optimum can be used to load optimized models from the [Hugging Face Hub](hf.co/models) and create pipelines
to run accelerated inference without rewriting your APIs.

## Switching from Transformers to Optimum Inference

The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging Face Transformers models. This means you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `ORTModelForXxx` class in `optimum`. For example, this is how you can use a question answering model in `optimum`:

```diff
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline
-from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering

-model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2") # pytorch checkpoint
+model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2") # onnx checkpoint
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering",model=model,tokenizer=tokenizer)

question = "What's my name?"
context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."
pred = onnx_qa(question, context)
```

Optimum Inference also includes methods to convert vanilla Transformers models to optimized ones. Simply pass `from_transformers=True` to the `from_pretrained()` method, and your model will be loaded and converted to ONNX on-the-fly:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the model from the hub and export it to the ONNX format
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english", from_transformers=True)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

# Create a pipeline
>>> onnx_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

>>> result = onnx_classifier("This is a great model")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998838901519775}]
```

### Working with the Hugging Face Model Hub

The Optimum model classes like [`~onnxruntime.ORTModelForSequenceClassification`] are integrated with the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://hf.co/models), which means you can not only
load model from the Hub, but also push your models to the Hub with `push_to_hub()` method. Below is an example which downloads a vanilla Transformers model
from the Hub and converts it to an optimum onnxruntime model and pushes it back into a new repository.

<!-- TODO: Add Quantizer into example when UX improved -->
```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the model from the hub and export it to the ONNX format
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english", from_transformers=True)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

# Save the converted model
>>> model.save_pretrained("a_local_path_for_convert_onnx_model")
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained("a_local_path_for_convert_onnx_model")

# Push the onnx model to HF Hub
>>> model.push_to_hub("a_local_path_for_convert_onnx_model", repository_id="my-onnx-repo", use_auth_token=True)
```

## Export and inference of sequence-to-sequence models

Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, that generate a new sequence from an input, can also be used when running inference with ONNX Runtime. When Seq2Seq models are exported to the ONNX format, they are decomposed into two parts : the encoder and the "decoder" (which actually consists of the decoder with the language modeling head), that are later combined during inference.
To leverage the pre-computed key/values hidden-states to speed up sequential decoding, simply pass `use_cache=True` to the `from_pretrained()` method. An additional model component will be exported: the "decoder" with pre-computed key/values as one of its inputs.
This specific export comes from the fact that during the first pass, the decoder has no pre-computed key/values hidden-states, while during the rest of the generation past key/values will be used to speed up sequential decoding.
Here is an example on how you can export a T5 model to the ONNX format and run inference for a translation task:


```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Load the model from the hub and export it to the ONNX format
>>> model = ORTModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("t5-small", from_transformers=True)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# Create a pipeline
>>> onnx_translation = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

>>> result = onnx_translation("My name is Eustache")
[{'translation_text': 'Mon nom est Eustache'}]
```
