# Configuration

The configuration classes are the way to specify how a task should be done. There are two tasks supported with the ONNX Runtime package:

1. Optimization: Performed by the [`~onnxruntime.ORTOptimizer`], this task can be tweaked using an [`~onnxruntime.configuration.OptimizationConfig`].

2. Quantization: Performed by the [`~onnxruntime.ORTQuantizer`], quantization can be set using a [`~onnxruntime.configuration.QuantizationConfig`]. A calibration step is required in some cases (post training static quantization), which can be specified using a [`~onnxruntime.configuration.CalibrationConfig`].
