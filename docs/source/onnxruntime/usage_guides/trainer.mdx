# How to accelerate training with ONNX Runtime

Optimum integrates ONNX Runtime Training through an `ORTTrainer` API that extends `Trainer` in [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).
With the solution, training time can be improved by greater than 35% for many popular Hugging Face models compared to PyTorch under eager mode.

[`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] APIs make it easy to compose __[ONNX Runtime (ORT)](https://onnxruntime.ai/)__ with other features in [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer).
It contains feature-complete training loop and evaluation loop, and supports hyperparameter search, mixed-precision training and distributed training with multiple [NVIDIA](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/accelerate-pytorch-transformer-model-training-with-onnx-runtime/ba-p/2540471)
and [AMD](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2021/07/13/onnx-runtime-release-1-8-1-previews-support-for-accelerated-training-on-amd-gpus-with-the-amd-rocm-open-software-platform/) GPUs.
With the ONNX Runtime backend, [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] take advantage of:

* Computation graph optimizations: constant foldings, node eliminations, node fusions
* Efficient memory planning
* Kernel optimization
* ORT fused Adam optimizer: batches the elementwise updates applied to all the model's parameters into one or a few kernel launches
* More efficient FP16 optimizer: eliminates a great deal of device to hos memory copies
* Mixed precision training

Test it out to achieve __lower latency, higher throughput, and larger maximum batch size__ while training models in 🤗Transformers!

## Performance

The chart shows impressive acceleration __from 39% to 130%__ for Hugging Face models with Optimum when __using ONNX Runtime and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 1__ for training.
The performance measurements were done on selected Hugging Face models with PyTorch as the baseline run, only ONNX Runtime for training as the second run, and ONNX
Runtime + DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 1 as the final run, showing maximum gains. The Optimizer used for the baseline PyTorch runs is the AdamW optimizer and the ORT Training
runs use the Fused Adam Optimizer(available in `ORTTrainingArguments`). The runs were performed on a single Nvidia A100 node with 8 GPUs.

</figure>

The version information used for these runs is as follows:
```
PyTorch: 1.14.0.dev20221103+cu116; ORT: 1.14.0.dev20221103001+cu116; DeepSpeed: 0.6.6; HuggingFace: 4.24.0.dev0; Optimum: 1.4.1.dev0; Cuda: 11.6.2
```

## Start by setting up the environment

To use ONNX Runtime for training, you need a machine with at least one NVIDIA or AMD GPU.

To use `ORTTrainer` or `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`, you need to install ONNX Runtime Training module and Optimum.

### Install ONNX Runtime

To set up the environment, we __strongly recommend__ you install the dependencies with Docker to ensure that the versions are correct and well
configured. You can find dockerfiles with various combinations [here](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker).

For example, if you want to install [onnxruntime-training 1.12.0](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/Dockerfile-ort1.12.0-cu113) via Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-ort1.12.0-cu113 -t <imagename:tag> .
```

If you want to install the dependencies beyond in a local Python environment. You can pip install them once you have CUDA 11.3 and cuDNN 8 well installed.

```bash
pip install onnx==1.12.0 ninja
pip install onnxruntime-training==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.onnxruntime.ai/onnxruntime_stable_cu113.html
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-ort
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
pip install --upgrade protobuf==3.20.1
```

And run post-installation configuration:

```bash
python -m torch_ort.configure
```

### Install Optimum

You can install Optimum via pypi:

```bash
pip install optimum
```

Or install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

This command installs the current main dev version of Optimum, which could include latest developments(new features, bug fixes). However, the
main version might not be very stable. If you run into any problem, please open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/issues) so
that we can fix it as soon as possible.

## ORTTrainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] class inherits the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Trainer` of transformers with `ORTTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTTrainer` compared with `Trainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer, ORTTrainingArguments

# Step 1: Define training arguments
-training_args = TrainingArguments(
+training_args = ORTTrainingArguments(
    output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
-   optim = "adamw_hf",
+   optim="adamw_ort_fused",
    ...
)

# Step 2: Create your ONNX Runtime Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = ORTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
+   feature="sequence-classification",
    ...
)

# Step 3: Use ONNX Runtime for training!🤗
trainer.train()
```

## ORTSeq2SeqTrainer

The [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] class is similar to the [`Seq2SeqTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Seq2SeqTrainer` of transformers with `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` compared with `Seq2SeqTrainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Seq2SeqTrainer, Seq2SeqTrainingArguments
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTSeq2SeqTrainer, ORTSeq2SeqTrainingArguments

# Step 1: Define training arguments
-training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(
+training_args = ORTSeq2SeqTrainingArguments(
    output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
-   optim = "adamw_hf",
+   optim="adamw_ort_fused",
    ...
)

# Step 2: Create your ONNX Runtime Seq2SeqTrainer
-trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
+trainer = ORTSeq2SeqTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
+   feature="seq2seq-lm",
    ...
)

# Step 3: Use ONNX Runtime for training!🤗
trainer.train()
```

## ORTTrainingArguments

The [`ORTTrainingArguments`] class inherits the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments)
class in Transformers. Besides the optimizers implemented in Transformers, it allows you to use the optimizers implemented in ONNX Runtime.
Replace `Seq2SeqTrainingArguments` with `ORTSeq2SeqTrainingArguments`:

```diff
-from transformers import TrainingArguments
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainingArguments

-training_args = TrainingArguments(
+training_args =  ORTTrainingArguments(
    output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
-   optim = "adamw_hf",
+   optim="adamw_ort_fused",  # Fused Adam optimizer implemented by ORT
)
```


<Tip warning={false}>

DeepSpeed is supported by ONNX Runtime(only ZeRO stage 1 and 2 for the moment).
You can find some [DeepSpeed configuration examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/tests/onnxruntime/ds_configs)
in the Optimum repository.

    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
