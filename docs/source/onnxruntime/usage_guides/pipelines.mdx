# Inference pipelines with the ONNX Runtime accelerator

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function makes it simple to use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
for accelerated inference on a variety of tasks such as text classification, question answering and image classification.

<Tip>

You can also use the
[pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) function from
Transformers and provide your Optimum model class.

</Tip>

Currently the supported tasks are:

* `feature-extraction`
* `text-classification`
* `token-classification`
* `question-answering`
* `zero-shot-classification`
* `text-generation`
* `text2text-generation`
* `summarization`
* `translation`
* `image-classification`
* `automatic-speech-recognition`
* `image-to-text`

## Optimum pipeline usage

While each task has an associated pipeline class, it is simpler to use the general [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function which wraps all the task-specific pipelines in one object.
The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function automatically loads a default model and tokenizer/feature-extractor capable of performing inference for your task.

1. Start by creating a pipeline by specifying an inference task:

```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> classifier = pipeline(task="text-classification", accelerator="ort")
```

2. Pass your input text/image to the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function:

```python
>>> classifier("I like you. I love you.")  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998838901519775}]
```

_Note: The default models used in the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function are not optimized for inference or quantized, so there won't be a performance improvement compared to their PyTorch counterparts._

### Using vanilla Transformers model and converting to ONNX

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function accepts any supported model from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).
There are tags on the Model Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task.

<Tip>

To be able to load the model with the ONNX Runtime backend, the export to ONNX needs
to be supported for the considered architecture.

You can check the list of supported architectures
[here](/exporters/onnx/package_reference/configuration#Supported-architectures).

</Tip>

Once you have picked an appropriate model, you can create the [`~pipelines.pipeline`] by specifying the model repo:

```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

# The model will be loaded to an ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.
>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model="deepset/roberta-base-squad2", accelerator="ort")
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

It is also possible to load it with the `from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, from_transformers=True)`
method associated with the `ORTModelForXXX` class.

For example, here is how you can load the [`~onnxruntime.ORTModelForQuestionAnswering`] class for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

>>> # Loading the PyTorch checkpoint and converting to the ONNX format by providing
>>> # from_transformers=True
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(
...     "deepset/roberta-base-squad2",
...     from_transformers=True
... )

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, accelerator="ort")
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

### Using Optimum models

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function is tightly integrated with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) and can load ONNX models directly.

```python
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model="optimum/roberta-base-squad2", accelerator="ort")
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```

It is also possible to load it with the `from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)`
method associated with the `ORTModelForXXX` class.

For example, here is how you can load the [`~onnxruntime.ORTModelForQuestionAnswering`] class for question answering:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")

>>> # Loading directly an ONNX model from a model repo.
>>> model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("optimum/roberta-base-squad2")

>>> onnx_qa = pipeline("question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, accelerator="ort")
>>> question = "What's my name?"
>>> context = "My name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg."

>>> pred = onnx_qa(question=question, context=context)
```


## Optimizing and quantizing in pipelines

The [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function can not only run inference on vanilla ONNX Runtime checkpoints - you can also use
checkpoints optimized with the [`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTQuantizer`] and the [`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTOptimizer`].

Below you can find two examples of how you could use the [`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTOptimizer`] and the
[`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTQuantizer`] to optimize/quantize your model and use it for inference afterwards.

### Quantizing with the `ORTQuantizer`

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import (
...     AutoQuantizationConfig,
...     ORTModelForSequenceClassification,
...     ORTQuantizer
... )
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> # Load the tokenizer and export the model to the ONNX format
>>> model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_dir = "distilbert_quantized"

>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

>>> # Load the quantization configuration detailing the quantization we wish to apply
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.avx512_vnni(is_static=False, per_channel=True)
>>> quantizer = ORTQuantizer.from_pretrained(model)

>>> # Apply dynamic quantization and save the resulting model
>>> quantizer.quantize(save_dir=save_dir, quantization_config=qconfig)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT

>>> # Load the quantized model from a local repository
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_dir)

>>> # Create the transformers pipeline
>>> onnx_clx = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, accelerator="ort")
>>> text = "I like the new ORT pipeline"
>>> pred = onnx_clx(text)
>>> print(pred)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
>>> # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9974810481071472}]

>>> # Save and push the model to the hub (in practice save_dir could be used here instead)
>>> model.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.push_to_hub("new_path_for_directory", repository_id="my-onnx-repo", use_auth_token=True)  # doctest: +SKIP
```

### Optimizing with `ORTOptimizer`

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import (
...     AutoOptimizationConfig,
...     ORTModelForSequenceClassification,
...     ORTOptimizer
... )
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import OptimizationConfig
>>> from optimum.pipelines import pipeline

>>> # Load the tokenizer and export the model to the ONNX format
>>> model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_dir = "distilbert_optimized"

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

>>> # Load the optimization configuration detailing the optimization we wish to apply
>>> optimization_config = AutoOptimizationConfig.O3()
>>> optimizer = ORTOptimizer.from_pretrained(model)

>>> optimizer.optimize(save_dir=save_dir, optimization_config=optimization_config)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT

# Load the optimized model from a local repository
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_dir)

# Create the transformers pipeline
>>> onnx_clx = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, accelerator="ort")
>>> text = "I like the new ORT pipeline"
>>> pred = onnx_clx(text)
>>> print(pred)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
>>> # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9973127245903015}]

# Save and push the model to the hub
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
>>> model.save_pretrained("new_path_for_directory")
>>> model.push_to_hub("new_path_for_directory", repository_id="my-onnx-repo", use_auth_token=True)  # doctest: +SKIP
```
