# Trainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] classes provide APIs for training PyTorch models with __[ONNX Runtime(ORT)](https://onnxruntime.ai/)__.
Taking ONNX Runtime as backend, [`ORTTrainer`] and [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] optimize the computation graph and the memory usage. They also support
mixed precision training implemented by ORT, as well as distributed training on multiple GPUs. With them, you will be able to achieve
__lower latency, higher throughput, and larger maximum batch size__ while training large transformers models.

## Prerequisite

To use ONNX Runtime for training, you need a machine with at least one NVIDIA or AMD GPU.

To use `ORTTrainer` or `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`, you need to install ONNX Runtime Training module and Optimum.

### Install ONNX Runtime

To set up the environment, we __strongly recommend__ you install the dependencies with Docker to ensure that the versions are correct and well
configured. You can find dockerfiles with various combinations [here](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker).

For example, if you want to install [onnxruntime-training 1.12.0](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/Dockerfile-ort1.12.0-cu113) via Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-ort1.12.0-cu113 -t <imagename:tag> .
```

If you want to install the dependencies beyond in a local Python environment. You can pip install them once you have CUDA 11.3 and cuDNN 8 well installed.

```bash
pip install onnx==1.12.0 ninja
pip install onnxruntime-training==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.onnxruntime.ai/onnxruntime_stable_cu113.html
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-ort
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
pip install --upgrade protobuf==3.20.1
```

And run post-installation configuration:

```bash
python -m torch_ort.configure
```

### Install Optimum

You can install Optimum via pypi:

```bash
pip install optimum
```

Or install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```

This command installs the current main dev version of Optimum, which could include latest developments(new features, bug fixes). However, the
main version might not be very stable. If you run into any problem, please open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/issues) so
that we can fix it as soon as possible.

## ORTTrainer

The [`ORTTrainer`] class inherits the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Trainer` of transformers with `ORTTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTTrainer` compared with `Trainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer

# Step 1: Create your ONNX Runtime Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = ORTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
+   feature="sequence-classification",
)

# Step 2: Use ONNX Runtime for training!🤗
train_result = trainer.train()
```

Check out more detailed [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/examples/onnxruntime/training) in the optimum repository.

## ORTSeq2SeqTrainer

The [`ORTSeq2SeqTrainer`] class is similar to the [`Seq2SeqTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainer)
of Transformers. You can easily adapt the codes by replacing `Seq2SeqTrainer` of transformers with `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` to take advantage of the acceleration
empowered by ONNX Runtime. Here is an example of how to use `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` compared with `Seq2SeqTrainer`:

```diff
-from transformers import Seq2SeqTrainer
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTSeq2SeqTrainer

# Step 1: Create your ONNX Runtime Seq2SeqTrainer
-trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
trainer = ORTSeq2SeqTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=valid_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics if training_args.predict_with_generate else None,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
+   feature="seq2seq-lm",
)

# Step 2: Use ONNX Runtime for training!🤗
train_result = trainer.train()
```

## ORTTrainingArguments

The [`ORTTrainingArguments`] class inherits the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments)
class in Transformers. Besides the optimizers implemented in Transformers, it allows you to use the optimizers implemented by ORT.
If you just want to use features implemented in Transformers, you can keep with `TrainingArguments`, otherwise replace it
with `ORTTrainingArguments`:

```diff
-from transformers import TrainingArguments
+from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainingArguments

-training_args = TrainingArguments(
+training_args =  ORTTrainingArguments(
    output_dir=tmp_dir,
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir=tmp_dir,
    optim="adamw_ort_fused",  # Fused Adam optimizer implemented by ORT
)
```

DeepSpeed is supported by ONNX Runtime(only ZeRO stage 1 and 2 for the moment).
You can find some [DeepSpeed configuration examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/tree/main/tests/onnxruntime/ds_configs)
in the Optimum repository.
