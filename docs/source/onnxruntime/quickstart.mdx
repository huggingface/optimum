# Quickstart

At its core, ðŸ¤— Optimum uses _configuration objects_ to define parameters for optimization on different accelerators. These objects are then used to instantiate dedicated _optimizers_, _quantizers_, and _pruners_.

Before applying quantization or optimization, we first need to export our model to the ONNX format.

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

>>> model_checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
>>> save_directory = "tmp/onnx/"
>>> # Load a model from transformers and export it to ONNX
>>> ort_model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, from_transformers=True)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)
>>> # Save the onnx model and tokenizer
>>> ort_model.save_pretrained(save_directory)
>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
```

Let's see now how we can apply dynamic quantization with ONNX Runtime:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoQuantizationConfig
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTQuantizer
>>> # Define the quantization methodology
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.arm64(is_static=False, per_channel=False)
>>> quantizer = ORTQuantizer.from_pretrained(ort_model)
>>> # Apply dynamic quantization on the model
>>> quantizer.quantize(save_dir=save_directory, quantization_config=qconfig)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
```

In this example, we've quantized a model from the Hugging Face Hub, but it could also be a path to a local model directory. The result from applying the `quantize()` method is a `model_quantized.onnx` file that can be used to run inference. Here's an example of how to load an ONNX Runtime model and generate predictions with it:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
>>> from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer
>>> model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_directory, file_name="model_quantized.onnx")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(save_directory)
>>> cls_pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> results = cls_pipeline("I love burritos!")
```

Similarly, you can apply static quantization by simply setting `is_static` to `True` when instantiating the `QuantizationConfig` object:

```python
>>> qconfig = AutoQuantizationConfig.arm64(is_static=True, per_channel=False)
```

Static quantization relies on feeding batches of data through the model to estimate the activation quantization parameters ahead of inference time. To support this, ðŸ¤— Optimum allows you to provide a _calibration dataset_. The calibration dataset can be a simple `Dataset` object from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library, or any dataset that's hosted on the Hugging Face Hub. For this example, we'll pick the [`sst2`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue/viewer/sst2/test) dataset that the model was originally trained on:

```python
>>> from functools import partial
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import AutoCalibrationConfig

# Define the processing function to apply to each example after loading the dataset
>>> def preprocess_fn(ex, tokenizer):
...     return tokenizer(ex["sentence"])

>>> # Create the calibration dataset
>>> calibration_dataset = quantizer.get_calibration_dataset(
...     "glue",
...     dataset_config_name="sst2",
...     preprocess_function=partial(preprocess_fn, tokenizer=tokenizer),
...     num_samples=50,
...     dataset_split="train",
... )
>>> # Create the calibration configuration containing the parameters related to calibration.
>>> calibration_config = AutoCalibrationConfig.minmax(calibration_dataset)
>>> # Perform the calibration step: computes the activations quantization ranges
>>> ranges = quantizer.fit(
...     dataset=calibration_dataset,
...     calibration_config=calibration_config,
...     operators_to_quantize=qconfig.operators_to_quantize,
... )
>>> # Apply static quantization on the model
>>> quantizer.quantize(    # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
...     save_dir=save_directory,
...     calibration_tensors_range=ranges,
...     quantization_config=qconfig,
... )
```

As a final example, let's take a look at applying _graph optimizations_ techniques such as operator fusion and constant folding. As before, we load a configuration object, but this time by setting the optimization level instead of the quantization approach:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime.configuration import OptimizationConfig

>>> # Here the optimization level is selected to be 1, enabling basic optimizations such as redundant node eliminations and constant folding. Higher optimization level will result in a hardware dependent optimized graph.
>>> optimization_config = OptimizationConfig(optimization_level=1)
```

Next, we load an _optimizer_ to apply these optimisations to our model:

```python
>>> from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTOptimizer

>>> optimizer = ORTOptimizer.from_pretrained(ort_model)

>>> # Optimize the model
>>> optimizer.optimize(save_dir=save_directory, optimization_config=optimization_config)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
```

And that's it - the model is now optimized and ready for inference! As you can see, the process is similar in each case:

1. Define the optimization / quantization strategies via an `OptimizationConfig` / `QuantizationConfig` object
2. Instantiate a `ORTQuantizer` or `ORTOptimizer` class
3. Apply the `quantize()` or `optimize()` method
4. Run inference

Happy optimising ðŸ¤—!
