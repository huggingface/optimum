# Language modeling training

The scripts [`run_clm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py) 
and [`run_mlm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_mlm.py)
allow us to apply different quantization approaches such as dynamic, static and aware-training quantization using 
different provider such as [Intel Neural Compressor (INC)](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) for language 
modeling tasks.


GPT and GPT-2 are trained or fine-tuned using a causal language modeling (CLM) loss. ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT and 
RoBERTa are trained or fine-tuned using a masked language modeling (MLM) loss, more information about the differences 
between those objectives can be found in our [model summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_summary.html).


### GPT-2/GPT and causal language modeling

The following example fine-tunes GPT-Neo on WikiText-2 while applying [`inc`](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor)  
quantization aware training. We're using the raw WikiText-2 (no tokens were replaced before the tokenization). The loss here is that of causal language modeling (CLM). 

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --provider inc \
    --quantize \
    --quantization_approach aware_training \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/clm_output
```

### RoBERTa/BERT/DistilBERT and masked language modeling

The following example fine-tunes RoBERTa on WikiText-2 while applying [`inc`](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) 
quantization aware training. We're using the raw  WikiText-2. The loss is different as BERT/RoBERTa have a bidirectional 
mechanism, we are therefore using the same loss that was used during their pre-training: masked language modeling (MLM) loss. 

```bash
python run_mlm.py \
    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --provider inc \
    --quantize \
    --quantization_approach aware_training \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/mlm_output
```

In order to apply dynamic, static or aware-training quantization, `quantization_approach` must be set to 
respectively `dynamic`, `static` or `aware_training`.

The configuration file can be specified by `config_name_or_path` and contains all the information related 
to the model quantization and tuning objective.  If no `config_name_or_path` is specified, the 
[default config file](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/config/inc/quantization.yml) 
will be used.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.
