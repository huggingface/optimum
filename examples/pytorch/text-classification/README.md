# Text classification 

## GLUE tasks

The script [`run_glue.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_glue.py)
allows us to apply different quantization approaches such as dynamic, static and aware-training quantization
using different provider such as [Intel Neural Compressor (INC)](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) for 
sequence classification tasks such as the ones from the [GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/).


The following example applies dynamic quantization on a DistilBERT fine-tuned on the sst-2 task, using the
[`inc`](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) provider: 


```bash
python run_glue.py \
    --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english \
    --task_name sst2 \
    --provider inc \
    --quantize \
    --config_name_or_path echarlaix/bert-base-dynamic-quant-test \
    --quantization_approach dynamic \
    --do_eval \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/sst2_output
```

In order to apply dynamic, static or aware-training quantization, `quantization_approach` must be set to 
respectively `dynamic`, `static` or `aware_training`.

The configuration file can be specified by `config_name_or_path` and contains all the information related 
to the model quantization and tuning objective.  If no `config_name_or_path` is specified, the 
[default config file](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/text-classification/config/inc/quantization.yml) 
will be used.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.
