# Language Modeling

## Image Classification Training

By running the scripts [`run_image_classification.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/image-classification/run_image_classification.py) we will be able to leverage the [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) accelerator to train the language models from the
[HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/models).


__The following example applies the acceleration features powered by ONNX Runtime.__


### ONNX Runtime Training

The following example trains ViT on beans dataset with mixed precision (fp16).

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPUS_YOU_HAVE run_image_classification.py \
    --model_name_or_path google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k \
    --dataset_name beans \
    --output_dir ./beans_outputs/ \
    --remove_unused_columns False \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --num_train_epochs 10 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 32 \
    --logging_strategy steps \
    --logging_steps 10 \
    --evaluation_strategy epoch \
    --seed 1337
```


__Note__
> *To enable ONNX Runtime training, your devices need to be equipped with GPU. Install the dependencies either with our prepared*
*[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/) or follow the instructions*
*in [`torch_ort`](https://github.com/pytorch/ort/blob/main/torch_ort/docker/README.md).*
