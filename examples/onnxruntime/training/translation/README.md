# Translation

By running the script [`run_translation.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/translation/run_translation.py),
we will be able to leverage the [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) to fine-tune the models from the
[HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for translation tasks.

### Supported Architectures

- `BartForConditionalGeneration`
- `T5ForConditionalGeneration`

`run_translation.py` is a lightweight examples of how to download and preprocess a dataset from the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library
or use your own files (jsonlines or csv), then fine-tune one of the architectures above on it.

For custom datasets in `jsonlines` format please see: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading_datasets.html#json-files.

__The following example applies the acceleration features powered by ONNX Runtime.__


### Onnxruntime Training

The following example fine-tunes a T5 large model on the wmt16 dataset.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPUS_YOU_HAVE run_translation.py \
    --model_name_or_path t5-large \
    --dataset_name wmt16 \
    --dataset_config ro-en \
    --label_smoothing 0.1 \
    --predict_with_generate \
    --source_lang en \
    --target_lang ro \
    --do_train \
    --max_train_samples 30000 \
    --fp16 \
    --output_dir /tmp/ort_t5_translation/
```

### Performance

We get the following results for [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) mixed precision training(fp16) on the previous
task under PyTorch and ONNX Runtime backends. A single Nvidia A100 card was used to run the experiment for 3 epochs::

| Model    | Backend      | Runtime(s) | Train samples(/s) |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| t5-large | PyTorch      | 2038.8     | 44.1              |
| t5-large | ONNX Runtime | 1536.7     | 58.6              |

We observe the gain of ONNX Runtime compared to PyTorch as follow:

|       | Latency | Throughput |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| Gain  | 24.63%  | 32.67%     |


__Note__

> *To enable ONNX Runtime training, your devices need to be equipped with GPU. Install the dependencies either with our prepared*
*[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/) or follow the instructions*
*in [`torch_ort`](https://github.com/pytorch/ort/blob/main/torch_ort/docker/README.md).*

> *The inference will use PyTorch by default, if you want to use ONNX Runtime backend instead, add the flag `--inference_with_ort`.*
