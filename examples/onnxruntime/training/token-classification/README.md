# Token classification

## NER Tasks

By running the script [`run_ner.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/token-classification/run_ner.py),
we will be able to leverage the [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) accelerator to fine-tune the models from the
[HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for token classification tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER).


__The following example applies the acceleration features powered by ONNX Runtime.__


### ONNX Runtime Training

The following example fine-tunes a BERT on the sst-2 task.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPUS_YOU_HAVE run_ner.py \
    --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
    --dataset_name conll2003 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/ort_bert_conll2003/
```

### Performance

We get the following results for [bert-large-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-cased) model mixed precision training(fp16) on the previous
task under PyTorch and ONNX Runtime backends. A single Nvidia A100 card was used to run the experiment for 7 epochs:

| Model            | Backend      | Runtime(s) | Train samples(/s) |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| bert-large-cased | PyTorch      | 711.5      | 138.1             |
| bert-large-cased | ONNX Runtime | 637.2      | 154.3             |

We observe the gain of ONNX Runtime compared to PyTorch as follow:

|       | Latency | Throughput |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| Gain  | 10.45%  | 11.67%     |


__Note__
> *To enable ONNX Runtime training, your devices need to be equipped with GPU. Install the dependencies either with our prepared*
*[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/) or follow the instructions*
*in [`torch_ort`](https://github.com/pytorch/ort/blob/main/torch_ort/docker/README.md).*

> *The inference will use PyTorch by default, if you want to use ONNX Runtime backend instead, add the flag `--inference_with_ort`.*
