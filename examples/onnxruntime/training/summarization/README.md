## Summarization

By running the script [`run_summarization.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/summarization/run_summarization.py),
you will be able to leverage the [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) accelerator to fine-tune and evaluate models from the
[HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/models) on summarization tasks.

### Supported models

Theoretically, all sequence-to-sequence models with [ONNXConfig](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/onnx/features.py) support in Transformers shall work, here are the models that the Optimum team has tested and validated.

* `Bart`
* `T5`

`run_summarization.py` is a lightweight example of how to download and preprocess a dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library or use your own files (jsonlines or csv), then fine-tune one of the architectures above on it.


__The following example applies the acceleration features powered by ONNX Runtime.__


### Onnx Runtime Training

The following example fine-tunes a BERT on the SQuAD 1.0 dataset.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPUS_YOU_HAVE run_summarization.py \
    --model_name_or_path t5-small \
    --dataset_name cnn_dailymail \
    --dataset_config "3.0.0" \
    --source_prefix "summarize: " \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --per_device_train_batch_size=4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size=4 \
    --output_dir /tmp/ort_summarization_t5/ \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --predict_with_generate
```

__Note__
> *To enable ONNX Runtime training, your devices need to be equipped with GPU. Install the dependencies either with our prepared*
*[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/) or follow the instructions*
*in [`torch_ort`](https://github.com/pytorch/ort/blob/main/torch_ort/docker/README.md).*

> *The inference will use PyTorch by default, if you want to use ONNX Runtime backend instead, add the flag `--inference_with_ort`.*
