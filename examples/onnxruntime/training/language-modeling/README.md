# Language Modeling

## Language Modeling Training

By running the scripts [`run_clm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/language-modeling/run_clm.py)
and [`run_mlm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/language-modeling/run_mlm.py),
we will be able to leverage the [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) accelerator to train the language models from the
[HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/models).


__The following example applies the acceleration features powered by ONNX Runtime.__


### ONNX Runtime Training

The following example trains GPT2 on wikitext-2 with mixed precision (fp16).

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPUS_YOU_HAVE run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --do_train \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm \
    --fp16
```


__Note__
> *To enable ONNX Runtime training, your devices need to be equipped with GPU. Install the dependencies either with our prepared*
*[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/training/docker/) or follow the instructions*
*in [`torch_ort`](https://github.com/pytorch/ort/blob/main/torch_ort/docker/README.md).*

> *The inference will use PyTorch by default, if you want to use ONNX Runtime backend instead, add the flag `--inference_with_ort`.*
