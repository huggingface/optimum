# Text classification 

## GLUE tasks

The script [`run_glue.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/optimization/text-classification/run_glue.py)
allows us to apply graph optimizations and fusion using [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) for sequence classification tasks such as 
the ones from the [GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/).

The following example applies graph optimization on a DistilBERT fine-tuned on the sst-2 task. Here the optimization level is selected to be 1, enabling basic optimizations such as redundant node eliminations and constant folding. Higher optimization level will result in hardware dependent optimized graph.

```bash
python run_glue.py \
    --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english \
    --task_name sst2 \
    --optimization_level 1 \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/optimized_distilbert_sst2
```
