# Text classification 

## GLUE tasks

The script [`run_glue.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/onnxruntime/quantization/text-classification/run_glue.py)
allows us to apply different quantization approaches (such as dynamic and static quantization) as well as graph 
optimizations using [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) for sequence classification tasks such as 
the ones from the [GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/).

The following example applies post-training dynamic quantization on a DistilBERT fine-tuned on the sst-2 task.

```bash
python run_glue.py \
    --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english \
    --task_name sst2 \
    --quantization_approach dynamic \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/quantized_distilbert_sst2
```

In order to apply dynamic or static quantization, `quantization_approach` must be set to  respectively `dynamic` or `static`.
