# How to contribute to Optimum?

Optimum is an open source project, so all contributions and suggestions are welcome.

You can contribute in many different ways: giving ideas, answering questions, reporting bugs, proposing enhancements, improving the documentation, fixing bugs,...

Many thanks in advance to every contributor.

## How to work on an open Issue?
You have the list of open Issues at: https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/issues

Some of them may have the label `help wanted`: that means that any contributor is welcomed!

If you would like to work on any of the open Issues:

1. Make sure it is not already assigned to someone else. You have the assignee (if any) on the top of the right column of the Issue page.

2. You can self-assign it by commenting on the Issue page with one of the keywords: `#take` or `#self-assign`.

3. Work on your self-assigned issue and eventually create a Pull Request.

## How to create a Pull Request?
1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/optimum.git
	cd optimum
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
	```

3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:

	```bash
	git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes
	```

	**do not** work on the `main` branch.

4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:

	```bash
	pip install -e ".[dev]"
	```

   (If optimum was already installed in the virtual environment, remove
   it with `pip uninstall optimum` before reinstalling it in editable
   mode with the `-e` flag.)

5. Develop the features on your branch.

6. Format your code. Run black and ruff so that your newly added files look nice with the following command:

	```bash
	make style
	```

7.  Once you're happy with your changes, add the changed files using `git add` and make a commit with `git commit` to record your changes locally:

	```bash
	git add modified_file.py
	git commit
	```

	It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original
	repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:

	```bash
	git fetch upstream
	git rebase upstream/main
    ```

   Push the changes to your account using:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes
   ```

8. Once you are satisfied, go the webpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on "Pull request" to send your to the project maintainers for review.
