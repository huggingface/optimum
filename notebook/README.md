# ðŸ¤— Optimum Notebooks
ðŸ¤—  [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) is an extension of ðŸ¤— [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), providing a set of performance optimization tools enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on targeted hardwares.

You can find here a list of the official notebooks, leveraging the usage of the Optimum library for different providers.
