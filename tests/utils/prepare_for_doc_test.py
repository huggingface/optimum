""" Style utils to preprocess files for doc tests.

    The doc processing function can be run on a list of files and/or
    directories of files. It will recursively check if the files have
    a python code snippet by looking for a ```python or ```py syntax.
    In the default mode - `remove_new_line==False` the script will
    add a new line before every python code ending ``` line to make
    the docstrings ready for pytest doctests.
    However, we don't want to have empty lines displayed in the
    official documentation which is why the new line command can be
    reversed by adding the flag `--remove_new_line` which sets
    `remove_new_line==True`.

    When debugging the doc tests locally, please make sure to
    always run:

    ```python utils/prepare_for_doc_test.py src docs```

    before running the doc tests:

    ```pytest --doctest-modules $(cat utils/documentation_tests.txt) -sv --doctest-continue-on-failure --doctest-glob="*.mdx"```

    Afterwards you should revert the changes by running

    ```python utils/prepare_for_doc_test.py src docs --remove_new_line```
